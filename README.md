# Diffinators

Scripts to generate diff reports for distro packaging branches.

## Description

I use this to generate simple HTML reports which display diffs between
upstream SmokeStack packaging branches and downstream distro packaging.

## How to run it:

Run the script:
```bash
bash fedora.bash
```

** This generates a report in fedora/out-report/index.html with links to the patch/diffs.
